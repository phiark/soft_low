# FRCNet

FRCNet is a document-driven research codebase for a resolution-content disentangled explicit-unknown network.

Current archive state:

- package version: `0.6.0`
- project state: **V0.6C clean partial evidence archive**
- primary archive record: [V0.6C Archive Closure Review](records/reviews/2026-04-27_review_v0_6c_archive_closure.md)
- governance status: [Project Archive Status](docs/governance/project_archive_status.md)

The project is archived as a clean partial evidence milestone. It is not a strong final paper result. New model training, architecture changes, or scientific claim expansion should start from a new explicit version plan.

## Model Contract

The canonical FRCNet factorization is:

```text
p_k = r * c_k
u = 1 - r
q_beta = p_top1 + beta * u
```

Where:

- `r` is the resolution ratio.
- `c` is the class distribution inside the resolved subspace.
- `u` is the unknown mass.
- `q_beta` is a completion-dependent scalar readout.

Engineering identifiers intentionally use stable names such as `resolution_ratio`, `content_distribution`, `unknown_mass`, and `completion_score` instead of paper-local single-letter variables.

## Archive Result

V0.6C narrowed the evidence target from unseen CIFAR100 source generalization to CIFAR100 class-holdout near-OOD evidence.

Final aggregate interpretation:

- unseen CIFAR100 held-out classes pair AUROC: `0.6512 +/- 0.0112`
- all-OOD pair AUROC: `0.8019 +/- 0.0076`
- worst-source pair AUROC: `0.6435 +/- 0.0214`
- seen-unseen gap: `0.2178 +/- 0.0020`
- evidence grade: clean partial repair

Integrity checks:

- train/validation source fingerprint overlap: `0`
- train/final source fingerprint overlap: `0`
- validation/final source fingerprint overlap: `0`
- CIFAR100 seen classes: `[0, 50)`
- CIFAR100 held-out classes: `[50, 100)`

Known archived limitations:

- The result is below the strong repair target.
- Pair-vs-scalar margin remains small.
- Hard resolver quality remains limited.
- `balanced` checkpoint policy outperformed the configured primary `near_ood_balanced` policy on unseen CIFAR100.

Generated checkpoints, study outputs, logs, and caches are ignored by default. Normal commits should contain source, config, docs, tests, and compact records only.

Older v0.2, v0.3, v0.4, v0.5, v0.6A, and v0.6B records remain available for traceability, but V0.6C is the archived baseline.

## Environment

The validated local maintenance interpreter is `.venv313/bin/python`.

Run the test suite:

```bash
.venv313/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

For a fresh environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
```

Runtime support remains available for Apple Silicon `MPS`, Linux `ROCm`, Linux `CUDA`, and CPU fallback. See [Runtime Environment Matrix](docs/architecture/runtime_environment_matrix.md).

## Maintenance Commands

Dry-run checkpoint cleanup:

```bash
.venv313/bin/python scripts/cleanup_checkpoints.py
```

Execute generated checkpoint cleanup:

```bash
.venv313/bin/python scripts/cleanup_checkpoints.py --execute
```

The cleanup command only scans generated-output roots by default and retains `checkpoint_best*` and `checkpoint_last*`.

Verify artifact hygiene:

```bash
git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard
git diff --cached --name-only | rg '^artifacts/'
```

Both commands should produce no output for a normal maintenance commit.

## Historical Workflows

The previous training and study CLIs remain for reproducibility:

```bash
.venv313/bin/python scripts/run_plan_a_study.py \
  --study-config configs/study/plan_a_next_v0_6c_near_ood_cifar100_class_holdout.yaml
```

These commands should not be used to create new claims under the archived V0.6C baseline. New experiments require a new version plan and new records.
